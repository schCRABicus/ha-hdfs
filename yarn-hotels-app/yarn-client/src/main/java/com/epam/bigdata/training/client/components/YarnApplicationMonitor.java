/**
 * A dedicated service which constantly communicates with the RM
 * and requests for a report of the application via the getApplicationReport() method of YarnClient.
 *
 * <p />
 * The ApplicationReport received from the RM consists of the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         General application information:
 *         Application id, queue to which the application was submitted,
 *         user who submitted the application and the start time for the application.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         ApplicationMaster details:
 *         the host on which the AM is running,
 *         the rpc port (if any) on which it is listening for requests from clients
 *         and a token that the client needs to communicate with the AM.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Application tracking information:
 *         If the application supports some form of progress tracking,
 *         it can set a tracking url which is available via ApplicationReportâ€™s getTrackingUrl() method
 *         that a client can look at to monitor progress.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Application status:
 *         The state of the application as seen by the ResourceManager is available via
 *         ApplicationReport#getYarnApplicationState.
 *         If the YarnApplicationState is set to FINISHED, the client should refer to
 *         ApplicationReport#getFinalApplicationStatus to check for the actual success/failure of the
 *         application task itself.
 *         In case of failures, ApplicationReport#getDiagnostics may be useful to shed
 *         some more light on the the failure.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
